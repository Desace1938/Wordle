How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning was focused on creating the popular game with simple JS and CSS functions. 

Optimizations
An option to improve this project would be to replace the single word with API word randomizer to keep the game going and random. 
I would also have included the option to have darkmode/lightmode, resize the board to a true size of the original Wordle, and included the keyboard.


Lessons Learned:
I learned to begin the project with simplicity and later go back to improve.
